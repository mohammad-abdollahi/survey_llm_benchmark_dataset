# Surveying the Benchmarking Landscape of Large Language Models in Code Intelligence

Welcome to the official repository for our survey paper:

**“Surveying the Benchmarking Landscape of Large Language Models in Code Intelligence”**
<!-- *(January 2020 – June 2025)* -->

## 📌 Overview

With the rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-2, GPT-3, and their successors, there has been a transformative shift in the field of **code intelligence**, enabling significant advances in tasks like code generation, program repair, software testing, and debugging.

To ensure these models are evaluated rigorously and meaningfully, **benchmarking** plays a crucial role.

In this work, we systematically review:

* **142 research papers**
* **156 unique benchmark datasets**
* **32 different code-related tasks**

We analyze each dataset across four key dimensions:

1. **General landscape and coverage**
2. **Dataset construction and quality assurance**
3. **Evaluation protocols**
4. **Limitations and gaps**

## 🔍 Key Findings

* **Python** is the most dominant language (used in 77% of datasets)
* **GitHub** is the primary data source (46% usage)
* Most benchmarks focus on **code generation** (86 datasets)
* Benchmark creation has notably accelerated in the past 3 years
* Gaps exist in terms of **bias**, **dataset evolution**, and **standardized evaluation**

<!-- ## 📈 Vision for the Future

We advocate for a new generation of benchmark datasets that are:

* More **robust** and **adaptable**
* Better aligned with **real-world coding challenges**
* Designed with **practical evaluation needs** in mind -->
