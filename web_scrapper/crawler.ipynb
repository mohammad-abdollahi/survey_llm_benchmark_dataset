While recent advancements in\\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have achieved superior performance in numerous\\nsummarization tasks, a benchmarking study of the SOS task using LLMs is yet to\\nbe performed. As LLMs' responses are sensitive to slight variations in prompt\\ndesign, a major challenge in conducting such a benchmarking study is to\\nsystematically explore a variety of prompts before drawing a reliable\\nconclusion. Fortunately, very recently, the TELeR taxonomy has been proposed\\nwhich can be used to design and explore various prompts for LLMs. Using this\\nTELeR taxonomy and 15 popular LLMs, this paper comprehensively evaluates LLMs\\non the SOS Task, assessing their ability to summarize overlapping information\\nfrom multiple alternative narratives. For evaluation, we report\\nwell-established metrics like ROUGE, BERTscore, and SEM-F1$ on two different\\ndatasets of alternative narratives. We conclude the paper by analyzing the\\nstrengths and limitations of various LLMs in terms of their capabilities in\\ncapturing overlapping information The code and datasets used to conduct this\\nstudy are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/llm_eval-E16D.\", 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17008v1'}\n",

However, their performance on\\nLow-Resource Programming Languages (LRPLs) and Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs)\\nremains a significant challenge, affecting millions of developers-3.5 million\\nusers in Rust alone-who cannot fully utilize LLM capabilities. LRPLs and DSLs\\nencounter unique obstacles, including data scarcity and, for DSLs, specialized\\nsyntax that is poorly represented in general-purpose datasets.\\n  Addressing these challenges is crucial, as LRPLs and DSLs enhance development\\nefficiency in specialized domains, such as finance and science.

Our survey fills\\nthis gap by systematically reviewing the current state, methodologies, and\\nchallenges in leveraging LLMs for code generation in these languages. We\\nfiltered 111 papers from over 27,000 published studies between 2020 and 2024 to\\nevaluate the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in LRPLs and DSLs.

Lauvrak, Jon Atle Gulla, Heri Ramampiaro', 'published': '2024-10-04T20:12:39Z', 'summary': \"With the rapid advancement of Natural Language Processing in recent years,\\nnumerous studies have shown that generic summaries generated by Large Language\\nModels (LLMs) can sometimes surpass those annotated by experts, such as\\njournalists, according to human evaluations. However, there is limited research\\non whether these generic summaries meet the individual needs of ordinary\\npeople. The biggest obstacle is the lack of human-annotated datasets from the\\ngeneral public. Existing work on personalized summarization often relies on\\npseudo datasets created from generic summarization datasets or controllable\\ntasks that focus on specific named entities or other aspects, such as the\\nlength and specificity of generated summaries, collected from hypothetical\\ntasks without the annotators' initiative. To bridge this gap, we propose a\\nhigh-quality, personalized, manually annotated abstractive summarization\\ndataset called PersonalSum. This dataset is the first to investigate whether\\nthe focus of public readers differs from the generic summaries generated by\\nLLMs. It includes user profiles, personalized summaries accompanied by source\\nsentences from given articles, and machine-generated generic summaries along\\nwith their sources. We investigate several personal signals - entities/topics,\\nplot, and structure of articles - that may affect the generation of\\npersonalized summaries using LLMs in a few-shot in-context learning scenario.\\nOur preliminary results and analysis indicate that entities/topics are merely\\none of the key factors that impact the diverse preferences of users, and\\npersonalized summarization remains a significant challenge for existing LLMs.\", 'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03905v1'}\n",
